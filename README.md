# Plasticine
Procedural Mesh generation framework for Unity

Can be used to create geometry in editor mode or in game mode.
Vertices can be shared or not. Normals are smoothed depending on a limit angle.

## Limitations
UV Mapping is not an easy to handle in procedural geometry. This projet has a way to use it, you may find it painfull. 

## Code Usage
Can be used directly in unity, or a dll can be built in a separate project

## Tests
Core classes have unit tests (NUnit)
Some Unity test scenes are provided
