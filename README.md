# Plasticine
Procedural Mesh generation framework for Unity

![Plasticine picture](Plasticine.png)

Can be used to create geometry in editor mode or in game mode.
Vertices can be shared or not. Normals are smoothed depending on a limit angle.

## Limitations
UV Mapping is not easy to handle in procedural geometry. This projet has a way to use it, you may find it painfull. 

## Code Usage
Can be used directly in Unity, or via a dll built in a separate project (project not provided). MonoDevelop can do that very well.

## Tests
Core classes have unit tests (NUnit)
Some Unity test scenes are provided
